The system is designed to react to an undesired gas presence. In the event of a gas leak the system is required to perform two functions. It isolates the sections so that the size of the leak is limited to the inventory contained between the two isolation valves, and de-pressurises the section by flaring the gas. Isolation is achieved by closing two normally open isolation valves. Flaring the gas is achieved by opening the normally closed blowdown valve between the two isolation valves. The gas leak is detected by two sensors. One (SD1), is a sonic detector, the other (CD1) triggers on gas concentration, both are directly connected to the computer. The controlling computer will issue a system trip as soon as either of the detectors indicate a gas presence. The computer will automatically drop out a relay which removes power to each of the 3 valves. As a secondary means of achieving the same objective an alarm is sounded which informs the operator of the leak. The operator then activates the push button to de-energise the valves. Given a gas leak the system should perform three tasks: • close isolation valve V1 • close isolation valve V2 • open blowdown valve V3.
