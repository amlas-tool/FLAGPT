SYSTEM DESCRIPTION SUMMARY
 The Wheel Brake System is installed on the two main landing gears. Braking on the main gear wheels is used to provide safe retardation of the aircraft during taxiing and landing phases, and in the event of a rejected take-off. The wheel brakes also prevent unintended aircraft motion when parked, and may be used to provide differential braking for aircraft directional control. A secondary function of the wheel brake system is to stop main gear wheel rotation upon gear retraction.  Braking on the ground is commanded either manually, via brake pedals, or automatically (autobrake) without the need for pedal application. The Autobrake function allows the pilot to prearm the deceleration rate prior to takeoff or landing. Autobrake is only available with the NORMAL braking system. The eight main gear wheels have multi-disc carbon brakes. 
 
 Based on the requirement that loss of all wheel braking is less probable than 5E-7 per flight, a design decision was made that each wheel has a brake assembly operated by two independent sets of hydraulic pistons. One set is operated from the GREEN hydraulic supply and is used in the NORMAL braking mode. 
 
 The Alternate Mode is on standby and is selected automatically when the NORMAL system fails. It is operated independently using the BLUE hydraulic power supply and is backed by an accumulator which is also used to drive the parking brake. The accumulator supplies the ALTERNATE system in the EMERGENCY braking mode, when the BLUE supply is lost and the NORMAL mode is not available. Switch-over is automatic under various failure conditions, or can be manually selected. Reduction of GREEN pressure below a threshold value, either from loss of GREEN supply itself or from its removal by the BSCU due to the presence of faults, causes an automatic selector to connect the BLUE supply to the ALTERNATE brake system. 
 
 An anti-skid facility is available in both the NORMAL and ALTERNATE modes, and operates at all speeds greater than 2 meters per second.  In the NORMAL braking mode, all eight wheels are individually braked from their own servo valves, which are also used to apply anti-skid. In the ALTERNATE mode, a dual metering valve provides a low pressure hydraulic braking input via four servo valves which provide the antiskid function to four pairs of wheels. Operation of the ALTERNATE system is precluded when the NORMAL system is in use.  In the NORMAL mode, the brake pedal position is electrically fed to a braking computer. This in turn produces corresponding control signals to the brakes. 
 
 In addition, this computer monitors various signals which denote certain critical aircraft and system states, to provide correct brake functions and improve system fault tolerance, and generates warnings, indications and maintenance information to other systems. This computer is accordingly named the Braking System Control Unit (BSCU). It automatically provides the following functions. a. Takeover of manual braking (brake pedals), or automatic controls (engagement of Autobrake, autopilot commands during CAT IIIb landing)  b. Control of interfaces with other aircraft systems  (Editorâ€™s Note: Interfaces with other systems may include the hydraulic system, the brake temperature monitoring system, etc.)  c. Generation of braking commands, according to commands received and the status of the system  d. Braking regulation in order to avoid skidding of the main wheels  e. Transmission of information (indications, lights, warnings, etc.) to the flight deck and to the various aircraft computers concerning the BSCU status.
